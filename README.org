* SIGPwny Presentation Template

** Quickstart Using Markdown

I assume you have TeXLive Full and Pandoc installed:
#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo apt install texlive-full pandoc
#+END_SRC

Clone this repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sigpwny/presentation-format
cd presentation-format
#+END_SRC

Export =simple-md-example.md= to PDF by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC
pandoc -t beamer simple-md-example.md -o simple-md-example.pdf
#+END_SRC

Open it and make sure it looks as you expect.

Your presentation is ready. To edit a presentation, edit the source
Markdown file, it should be quite intuitive.

In general, you can create another =.md= file and do the exactly
same thing. As long as the =.sty= file and =pwny.png= are in the
same directory, export will work correctly.

* Note
=tex-example= is how you'd use the Beamer theme in pure LaTeX, if
you're so inclined.

* TODO
Write more complete documentation.
